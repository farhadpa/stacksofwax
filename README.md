## The web development module project repository  

StacksOfWax is a website that enables users to browse Vinyl music collections shared by other users
of the site. The website allows anonymous users to browse and search the website for collections
and Vinyl or Songs, artists and genres. It also allows them to register and become a member of the
vinyl collection sharing community and gain access to extra functionality. 

Registered users can create their own collections which other users can view. Member users can
add Vinyl to their profiles. They also can manage their collections later and add or remove vinyl to
and from a collection or completely delete the collection as well as Vinyl. Registered users can like
other usersâ€™ collections. Obviously, they cannot like their own collections. They also can Review
collections on the website including their own collections which enables them to discuss their
collections with other members of the website. 

Each registered user can create as many collections as they want, and each collection can have zero
or many records of vinyl. The system is defined to assign Genres to Vinyl. So basically, a vinyl can
have one or more tracks/songs which can belong to the same or different artists and be from
different genres in their nature. So, vinyls can have multiple genres. 

The system has a user-friendly interface that allows users to easily register, log in, and work with the
website. It also benefits from responsive design, ensuring that it is accessible from any device
including desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile smartphones. 

The system also features an advanced search capability that allows users to search the website and
get comprehensive information and results that correspond to their searches including collections
and their vinyls, vinyls and the collections they belong to, songs, genres, etc. 

StacksOfWax is an intuitive and user-friendly platform that offers a community-based approach to
vinyl music collections and provides sharing experience for all vinyl records enthusiasts.
